“Data lakes are hard to do right”

“People thought, ‘Let’s just land a whole bunch of data in a lake, and that will solve all our problems.’ But that just kicked off a whole other set of manual paths and one-off projects required to get data out of the lakes.”
“Data is only useful if you can integrate it, cleanse it, and get it into a shape and format that can be fed into the analytical algorithms that data scientists and analysts use daily. That is 80% of the work, the analytics part is straightforward after that.”
“Where data lakes fail is where they are a technology exercise with a weak business driver. Success hinges as much on operational efficiency as it does on advances in research.”
